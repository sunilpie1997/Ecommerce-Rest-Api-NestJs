    NestJs is a framework to build scalable nodejs applications.

    Introduction:

    This is a platform for small retailers to bring their shop on cloud so that they 
    can have competitive edge over ecommerce-platforms.

    Each retailer when registers can add their shops But they can only sell when admin
    set 'can_sell' property of 'shop' to 'true'.

    Otherwise retailer have full control over their shop.They decide wheteher it is 'online'
    or 'offline' base on the value of property 'status' of 'shop'
